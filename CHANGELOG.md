## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **BatchDecoder: frames near end of file were undecodable.** The decode loop
  exited at EOF without flushing the decoder, so frames buffered behind
  B-frame reorder delay (the final GOP) were never emitted and `get_batch`
  raised `RuntimeError: Failed to decode frame N`. Now sends a null packet and
  drains at EOF; a `decoderDrained_` flag forces a re-seek before the next
  target so the drained decoder is flushed before reuse.
  *(Verified: requesting the last frames of a 600-frame clip failed before, passes now.)*
- **Encoder: reused CPU frame could be corrupted in flight.** `cpuFrame` is
  reused across `encode_frame` calls; a software encoder with B-frames /
  threading keeps a reference to a submitted frame, so overwriting the buffer
  in place could corrupt an in-flight frame. Added `av_frame_make_writable`
  (copy-on-write) before each conversion.
- **Encoder: `fps=0` produced an invalid time base.** A zero/negative fps
  rounded to `0`, yielding `time_base {1,0}` and a codec-open failure
  (`Failed to open video codec: ... (Invalid argument)`). fps is now clamped to
  a minimum of 1. *(Verified: `fps=0` failed before, produces a valid file now.)*
- **Encoder: silent failures on the encode/drain path.** The
  `avcodec_receive_packet` loops in `encodeFrame` and `close` swallowed genuine
  errors (anything other than `EAGAIN`/`EOF`) and still reported success, and
  `av_interleaved_write_frame` return values were ignored (disk-full / broken
  pipe undetectable). All three now check and log/propagate errors.
- **Decoder::seekFrame: wrong target on non-integer frame rates + off-by-one.**
  Used `static_cast<int>(fps)` (e.g. 29.97 → 29) when computing the target PTS,
  and the bounds check allowed `frameIndex == totalFrames`. Now uses the exact
  frame-rate rational (`av_inv_q`) and rejects out-of-range indices while still
  permitting seeks when `totalFrames` is unknown.
- **VideoReader::decodeFrame: undefined behavior on NVDEC→CPU fallback.** The
  fallback recursed into `decodeFrame()` while the function's
  `gil_scoped_release` was still active, constructing a second GIL release with
  the GIL already dropped. Replaced the recursion with a retry loop.
- **GPU RGB→YUV converter: unchecked device-to-host copies.** `cudaMemcpy` /
  `cudaMemcpy2D` return codes in the NV12 / P010 / NV16 / YUV420p / YUV444
  CPU-frame copy helpers were ignored, letting a failed copy yield a silently
  corrupt frame. Routed through checked `copyPlane2DToHost` / `copyPlaneToHost`
  helpers.
- **bench_encode_quality.py: comparisons garbled for non-720p sources.** The
  raw-RGB decode used `-vf format=rgb24` with no scale while all downstream
  size math and PSNR/SSIM comparisons assumed the configured `w x h`. Added an
  explicit `scale={w}:{h}` to both decode helpers.
